===============================================================================

Prerequisites
-------------

    To build the project you need the following:

        - JDK 1.6
        - Maven (>= 3.0.3)


Continuous Integration Configuration
------------------------------------

    Continuous Integration platform has to be configured to run
    "mvn deploy" on every commit. Besides that the platform has to
    have "settings.xml", "pubring.gpg", and "secring.gpg" files available
    near the project source code base. These files are not inside SVN
    repository for security reasons. They have to be provided by the CI
    platform owner (the project owner, in most cases). "settings.xml"
    file has to document connection settings to the sonatype repository
    and web deployment platform. For example (this is a complete example
    of "setting.xml" file):

    <settings>
     <profiles>
      <profile>
       <id>ci</id>
       <properties>
        <gpg.homedir>../../closures/</gpg.homedir>
        <gpg.keyname>...</gpg.keyname>
        <gpg.passphrase>....</gpg.passphrase>
       </properties>
      </profile>
     </profiles>
     <servers>
      <server>
       <id>jcabi.s3</id>
       <username>....</username>
       <password>....</password>
      </server>
      <server>
       <id>sonatype.nexus</id>
       <username>....</username>
       <password>....</password>
      </server>
     </servers>
    </settings>

    At the moment the following two goals are defined in our CI
    server:

    1) mvn clean deploy site-deploy -e -Dci --settings ../../closures/settings.xml


How to release new version to Maven Central:
---------------------------------

    1. Create a new ticket in GitHub, explaining why you want to release
       a new version

    2. Create new branch, see https://github.com/yegor256/jcabi/issues/87
       for a live example

    3. Replace <version jcabi="yes">...</version> with the next
       version you want to use, e.g.:

        find . -name "*.xml" -exec sed -i "" 's|\(\<version jcabi\=\"yes\"\>\)1\.0\-SNAPSHOT\(\<\/version\>\)|\10.1\2|g' {} \;

    4. Update releasedVersion property in pom.xml

    5. Commit/push your changes to GitHub

    6. Read these pages:
        https://docs.sonatype.org/display/Repository/Sonatype+OSS+Maven+Repository+Usage+Guide
        http://www.sonatype.com/books/nexus-book/reference/staging-sect-managing-plugin.html
        https://docs.sonatype.org/display/Repository/How+To+Generate+PGP+Signatures+With+Maven

    7. Run "mvn -Dci -Pjcabi -Dsonatype clean deploy && mvn clean -Dsite site-deploy"

        Make sure that you have this profile in ~/.m2/settings.xml:

          <profile>
            <id>jcabi</id>
            <properties>
              <gpg.homedir>/code/gpg/jcabi</gpg.homedir>
              <gpg.keyname>...</gpg.keyname>
              <gpg.passphrase>...</gpg.passphrase>
            </properties>
          </profile>

    8. Tag the branch

        git tag -a jcabi-0.1.2 -m '#123: version 0.1.2 released to Maven Central'
        git push origin jcabi-0.1.2

    9. Delete the branch or merge it back to 'master' (if you did any changes). Don't
        forget to revert back version number:

        find . -name "*.xml" -exec sed -i "" 's|\(\<version jcabi\=\"yes\"\>\)0\.1\(\<\/version\>\)|\11.0-SNAPSHOT\2|g' {} \;

    10. Close the issue as "fixed" in Github

    That's it
