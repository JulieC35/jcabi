===============================================================================

Prerequisites
-------------

    To build the project you need the following:

        - JDK 1.6
        - Maven (>= 3.0.3)


Continuous Integration Configuration
------------------------------------

    Continuous Integration platform has to be configured to run
    "mvn deploy" on every commit. Besides that the platform has to
    have "settings.xml", "pubring.gpg", and "secring.gpg" files available
    near the project source code base. These files are not inside SVN
    repository for security reasons. They have to be provided by the CI
    platform owner (the project owner, in most cases). "settings.xml"
    file has to document connection settings to the sonatype repository
    and web deployment platform. For example (this is a complete example
    of "setting.xml" file):

    <settings>
     <profiles>
      <profile>
       <id>ci</id>
       <properties>
        <gpg.homedir>../../closures/</gpg.homedir>
        <gpg.keyname>...</gpg.keyname>
        <gpg.passphrase>....</gpg.passphrase>
       </properties>
      </profile>
     </profiles>
     <servers>
      <server>
       <id>www.jcabi.com</id>
       <username>....</username>
       <password>....</password>
      </server>
      <server>
       <id>oss.sonatype.org</id>
       <username>....</username>
       <password>....</password>
      </server>
     </servers>
    </settings>

    At the moment the following goal is defined in our CI server:

        mvn clean deploy -e -Dci --settings ../../closures/settings.xml


How to release new version to Maven Central:
---------------------------------
    https://docs.sonatype.org/display/Repository/Sonatype+OSS+Maven+Repository+Usage+Guide
    http://www.sonatype.com/books/nexus-book/reference/staging-sect-managing-plugin.html
    https://docs.sonatype.org/display/Repository/How+To+Generate+PGP+Signatures+With+Maven

    1. Create a new ticket in GitHub, explaining why you want to release
        a new version

    2. Create new branch, see https://github.com/yegor256/jcabi/issues/87
        for a live example

        git checkout -b 87

    3. Update version:

        mvn versions:use-latest-releases

    3. Replace <version jcabi="yes">...</version> with the next
        version you want to use, e.g.:

        find . -name "*.xml" -exec sed -i "" 's|\(\<version jcabi\=\"yes\"\>\)1\.0\-SNAPSHOT\(\<\/version\>\)|\10.5.4\2|g' {} \;

    4. Commit your changes

        git commit -am '#87: version set to 0.5.4'

    5. Explain this new release in changes/changes.xml release notes

    6. Deploy the product to Sonatype:

        mvn -Pqulice -Pjcabi -Psonatype clean deploy

        Make sure that you have this profile in ~/.m2/settings.xml:

          <profile>
            <id>jcabi</id>
            <properties>
              <gpg.homedir>/code/gpg/jcabi</gpg.homedir>
              <gpg.keyname>...</gpg.keyname>
              <gpg.passphrase>...</gpg.passphrase>
            </properties>
          </profile>

    7. Deploy the site to Amazon S3 (in 3-4 hours, when this artifact
        becomes available in Maven Central):

        mvn -Psite clean install site-deploy

    8. Tag the branch

        git tag -a jcabi-0.5.4 -m '#87: version 0.1.2 released to Maven Central'
        git push origin jcabi-0.5.4

    9. Revert version back to SNAPSHOT:

        find . -name "*.xml" -exec sed -i "" 's|\(\<version jcabi\=\"yes\"\>\)0\.5\.4\(\<\/version\>\)|\11.0-SNAPSHOT\2|g' {} \;
        git commit -am '#87: version back to SNAPSHOT'

    10. Merge the branch to 'master':

        git checkout master && git merge 87 && git push origin master && git branch -D 87

    11. Close the issue as "fixed" in Github

    That's it
