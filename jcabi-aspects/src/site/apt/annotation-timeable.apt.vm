Terminate Long Running Java Methods

  Annotate your methods with
  {{{./apidocs-${project.version}/com/jcabi/aspects/Timeable.html}<<<@Timeable>>>}}
  annotation and every time their execution takes more than allowed
  their thread will be interrupted:

+--
@Timeable(limit = 5, unit = TimeUnit.SECONDS)
public String load(URL url) {
  return url.openConnection().getContent();
}
+--

  The thread running this method will be terminated if it takes more
  than five seconds.

  The mechanism is implemented with AOP/AspectJ. Read
  {{{./index.html}how to integrate it into your <<<pom.xml>>>}}.
