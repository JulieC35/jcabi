Check Java Classes Immutability in Runtime

  Annotate your class with
  {{{./apidocs-${project.version}/com/jcabi/aspects/Immutable.html}<<<@Immutable>>>}}
  annotation and its immutability will be checked when instantiated:

+--
@Immutable
public class Foo {
  private String data; // this class is NOT immutable
}
+--

  During instantion of this class a runtime exception will be thrown,
  because it is mutable.

  Keep in mind, that although JDK requires some classes to be immutable,
  most of them are mutable in reality, for example
  {{{http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Date.html}<<<java.util.Date>>>}} and
  {{{http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/math/BigDecimal.html}<<<java.math.BigDecimal>>>}}
  (well, at least in OpenJDK 7 they are mutable). Our immutability checker
  is rather strict and doesn't allow classes to have any non-private non-final
  properties in order to be called truly immutable.

  If your class/interface has a property, which type is an interface, that
  child interface has to be <<<@Immutable>>> annotated, for example:

+--
@Immutable
public class Foo {
  // this class is NOT immutable because we can't guarantee
  // that an immutable implemenation of DateFormat will be
  // used in all its implementations.
  private final DateFormat format;
}
+--

  The mechanism is implemented with AOP/AspectJ. Read
  {{{./index.html}how to integrate it into your <<<pom.xml>>>}}.
