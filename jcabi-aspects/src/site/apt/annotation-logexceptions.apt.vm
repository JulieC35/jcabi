Logging exceptions thrown out of Java methods

  Annotate your methods with
  {{{./apidocs-${project.version}/com/jcabi/aspects/LogExceptions.html}<<<@LogExceptions>>>}}
  annotation and every exception thrown out of the method
  will be logged through SLF4J:

+--
@LogExceptions
public String load(URL url) {
  return url.openConnection().getContent();
}
+--

  In an exception occurs it will be logged.

  Also, take a look at {{{./annotation-loggable.html}<<<@Loggable>>>}}
  annotation which does the same but also logs non-exceptional situations.

  The mechanism is implemented with AOP/AspectJ. Read
  {{{./index.html}how to integrate it into your <<<pom.xml>>>}}.
