Useful Java AOP Aspects

  <<Notice>>: Experimental implementation.

  First, add these two artifacts to your <<<pom.xml>>>:

+--
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.jcabi</groupId>
  <artifactId>jcabi-aspects</artifactId>
  <version>${releasedVersion}</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.aspectj</groupId>
  <artifactId>aspectjrt</artifactId>
  <version>1.6.12</version>
  <scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>
+--

  Then, add this plugin:

+--
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>
  <artifactId>aspectj-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>1.4</version>
  <configuration>
    <complianceLevel>1.6</complianceLevel>
    <encoding>${project.build.sourceEncoding}</encoding>
    <showWeaveInfo>true</showWeaveInfo>
    <source>1.6</source>
    <target>1.6</target>
    <verbose>true</verbose>
    <aspectLibraries>
      <aspectLibrary>
        <groupId>com.jcabi</groupId>
        <artifactId>jcabi-aspects</artifactId>
      </aspectLibrary>
    </aspectLibraries>
  </configuration>
  <executions>
    <execution>
      <id>weave-classes</id>
      <phase>process-classes</phase>
      <goals>
        <goal>compile</goal>
      </goals>
    </execution>
  </executions>
</plugin>
+--

  Then, use one of our annotations:
  {{{./apidocs/com/jcabi/aspects/LogExceptions.html}LogExceptions}},
  {{{./apidocs/com/jcabi/aspects/RetryOnFailure.html}RetryOnFailure}}.
