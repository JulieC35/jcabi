Decors

  Log an event like this:

+--
import com.jcabi.log.Logger;
class Foo {
  void bar(int value) {
    final long start = System.nanoTime();
    // some operations
    Logger.debug(
      this,
      "bar(%d): done in %[nano]d",
      value,
      System.nanoTime() - start
    );
  }
}
+--

  You will see something like this in log:

---
[DEBUG] Foo: #bar(1234): done in 3.45ms
---

  Nano-seconds will be formatted as time through a built-in "decor".
  Pre-defined decors:

   * <<<dom>>> -- converts <<<org.w3c.dom.Node>>> to text.

   * <<<exception>>> -- exception message and full stacktrace;

   * <<<list>>> -- array or list of elements into text;

   * <<<ms>>> -- milliseconds into their text presentation;

   * <<<nano>>> -- nanoseconds into their text presentation;

   * <<<text>>> -- makes text readable;

   * <<<type>>> -- type name of the object.

  In order to use your own decor just implement <<<java.util.Formattable>>>:

+--
import com.jcabi.log.Decor;
import java.util.Formattable;
import java.util.Formatter;
public final class DataDecor implements Formattable {
    private final transient Data data;
    public DataDecor(final Data dat) {
        this.data = dat;
    }
    @Override
    public void formatTo(final Formatter formatter, final int flags,
        final int width, final int precision) {
        formatter.format("%s", this.data.getSomeValueOutOfIt());
    }
}
+--

  Then, provide its class name in log formatting string, for example:

+--
import com.jcabi.log.Logger;
Logger.debug(
  this,
  "bar(%d): show some data: %[com.example.DataDecor]s",
  value,
  data
);
+--
